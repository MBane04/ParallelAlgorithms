1.) compile your file with the -G debugging flag to use NSight

2.) use nsys to configure the NSight settings

3.) Profile your code using this command:
nsys profile -t cuda,opengl,nvtx,osrt ./[ExecutableName]

5.) NSight generates a file for you to use, open the .qdstrm file using nsys-ui
nsys-ui timeline_report.nsys-rep

6.) I have no idea how to make it persistent, so screenshot if you need it later


Meaning of the colors:

CPU Frame:
Green -> Frame completed quickly
Yellow -> Frame exceeded ideal time
Red -> Frame stuttered
Height shows activity duration


CUDA colors:
Blue -> Shows kernel execution (taller bars = More SMs occupied)
Purple -> Memory Transfer (light purple HtoD, Dark purple DtoH)
Orange/Yellow -> Sync point or blocking operations
